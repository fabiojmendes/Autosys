# Doorsys

## Introduction

Doorsys is basically a door access control system birth from the frustration
with consumer grade smart locks. I needed something more reliable with
centralized logs, multiple access codes and badge access and more importantly,
remote management. After surveying the landscape, I came to the conclusion that
either I settle for a subpar solution using and existing smartlock + app
available on the marketplace, or I have to spend an arm and a leg to get to a
solution that is more professional. So I did what every engineer would, I'll roll
my own! How difficult can it be... Famous last words.
